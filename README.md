# CIFAR-10-Classifier
CIFAR-10 is a collection of 60,000 labelled tiny images used to train and test Machine Learning Models to classify images. These are 32 x 32 size images and have 3 channels Red, Green and Blue.
There are 10 different classes of images namely-airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.
Here, we will train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch and try to improve its accuracy.
